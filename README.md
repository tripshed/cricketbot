A bot for /r/cricket
-----------

Currently, the bot just crawls the comments of the front page of http://reddit.com/r/cricket and looks for comments saying 'Hello'. The bot then replies to this saying 'World!'. It is a very simple functionality but more work is being done on searching through the text as this will allow more advanced functionality of the bot.
