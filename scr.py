Why Checkmarx Is Not the Right Tool for TLS Cipher Suite Detection

Checkmarx is a static application security testing (SAST) tool that scans application source code to identify vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle. While it is highly effective for catching issues like insecure coding patterns, hardcoded credentials, or weak cryptographic usage in code, it is not designed to detect TLS cipher suite configurations.

TLS cipher suites are typically negotiated at runtime, and their actual behavior depends on the underlying infrastructure, not just application code.

Key Limitation: Code-Level TLS Settings Are Often Overridden

Even if developers configure TLS protocols or cipher suites in code (e.g., using SSLContext or HttpsURLConnection), these settings are often overridden by web servers, application servers, load balancers, or network appliances such as:

NGINX, Apache HTTP Server

AWS ELB/ALB, Azure Front Door, Cloudflare

F5, Citrix ADC, or other reverse proxies


These components terminate TLS connections before they ever reach the application. As a result, any cipher suite settings in the application code may be irrelevant. The actual cipher suites and protocol versions used in production are defined by the server or network layer configuration.

Why Checkmarx Can’t Help Here

Checkmarx:

Cannot observe runtime behavior or TLS handshakes.

Cannot inspect live traffic or server-side SSL/TLS configuration.

Does not analyze infrastructure or device settings unless explicitly included and modeled in code.


What to Use Instead

To assess TLS configurations and cipher suites effectively, organizations should use:

TLS scanners like Qualys SSL Labs, testssl.sh, or Nmap's ssl-enum-ciphers

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools that simulate real-world traffic and observe encryption behavior

Infrastructure audits to review web server, load balancer, or appliance configurations


Recommendation

Use Checkmarx to secure your application’s source code. For validating secure TLS configurations in production, rely on runtime tools that are purpose-built to inspect encryption behavior across your actual infrastructure.
