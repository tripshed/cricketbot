          Live scorecard
        </h3>
          <p>When a match thread is created by the bot, it will auto-update the body of the post in regular intervals with the current score of the match.<br>

Usually in match threads, the OP isn't consistent with updating the match thread and so it is usually a static bit of text. This will allow for the score to continually update allowing for a new way to check the score and comment on the match simultaneously.<br>

Possible expansion areas from here are to perhaps have a timeline in chronological order of the key moments of the game. This will take a lot longer to implement, however.</p>
